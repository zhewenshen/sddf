 * PANCAKE PORT OF IMX8 uSDHC BLOCK DRIVER
 * ========================================
 *

 * This is a minimal Pancake port that provides the notified() entry point.
 * Most of the complex driver logic remains in C for maintainability.
 *

 * Strategy: Pancake handles the entry point, immediately calls C via FFI
 * FFI functions use @ syntax and take 4 parameters: (c, clen, a, alen)
